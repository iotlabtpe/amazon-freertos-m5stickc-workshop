# Create your AWS IoT Thing

## Creating a thing requires 3 main steps:

1. Create a thing for the device in IoT Core
2. Create a certificate and attach it to the thing
3. Create a Policy and attach it to the certificate

## Create a thing for your IoT device in AWS IoT Core

Navigate to IoT Core to enter AWS IoT services
![IoT Core 0]({{ "/assets/images/iotcore-0.png" | absolute_url }})

Follow the below 3 steps to register your thing:

1. Before you create a thing, please select the region. please select **us-east-1**
2. To Create a thing, navigate to Manager → Things
3. Click Create to start creation and registration of your device

![IoT Core 1]({{ "/assets/images/iotcore-1.png" | absolute_url }})

If this is the very first time you create a device, the following page will appear, please click “**Register a thing**” to get started

![IoT Core 2]({{ "/assets/images/iotcore-2.png" | absolute_url }})

In Creating AWS IoT Things page, choose **“create single thing“**

![IoT Core 3]({{ "/assets/images/iotcore-3.png" | absolute_url }})

Input a device name of your choice and click **“Next”**

![IoT Core 4]({{ "/assets/images/iotcore-4.png" | absolute_url }})

## Create a certificate and attach it to the thing

Choose One-click certificate creation

![IoT Core 5]({{ "/assets/images/iotcore-5.png" | absolute_url }})

Please download the certificate, public key and private key.

If this is the first time you create a thing in AWS IoT, you may not have a policy for the thing. you can click “Register Thing” and attach policy later.

![IoT Core 6]({{ "/assets/images/iotcore-6.png" | absolute_url }})

So let’s see exactly what was generated.

* a thing named “[YOUR CHOSEN DEVICE NAME]”

![IoT Core 7]({{ "/assets/images/iotcore-7.png" | absolute_url }})

* A certificate that is attached to the thing

![IoT Core 8]({{ "/assets/images/iotcore-8.png" | absolute_url }})

* certificates that you’ve downloaded in your local PC

![IoT Core 9]({{ "/assets/images/iotcore-9.png" | absolute_url }})

## Create a Policy and attach it to the certificate

Next step we will create a policy to the certificate we’ve created in the previous step
![IoT Core 10]({{ "/assets/images/iotcore-10.png" | absolute_url }})
input the policy name and enter advanced mode to past the policies
![IoT Core 11]({{ "/assets/images/iotcore-11.png" | absolute_url }})
copy the following policy statement into the statements


```bash
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "iot:Publish",
        "iot:Subscribe",
        "iot:Connect",
        "iot:Receive"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "*"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "greengrass:*"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

copy the above policy statement and create
![IoT Core 12]({{ "/assets/images/iotcore-12.png" | absolute_url }})

After creation, in the IoT Core console, navigate to **“Secure → Policies**“ your policy should be there 
![IoT Core 13]({{ "/assets/images/iotcore-13.png" | absolute_url }})

navigate to **“Secure → Certificates**“ 
![IoT Core 14]({{ "/assets/images/iotcore-14.png" | absolute_url }})

In the certificate page click **“Actions → Attach policy”**, 
![IoT Core 15]({{ "/assets/images/iotcore-15.png" | absolute_url }})

Select policy and attach
![IoT Core 16]({{ "/assets/images/iotcore-16.png" | absolute_url }})

Now, check the polices of the certificate, and the policy you’ve added should be there
![IoT Core 17]({{ "/assets/images/iotcore-17.png" | absolute_url }})
